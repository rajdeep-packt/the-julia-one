This is the code repository for [Mastering Julia](https://www.packtpub.com/product/mastering-julia-second-edition/9781805129790), published by Packt.

**Enhance your analytical and programming skills for data modeling and processing with Julia**

## What is this book about?
This book covers the application of Julia v1.8.x in the areas of scientific computing and data science. The book will be of use to those with some previous knowledge of Julia or as a primer for programmers familiar with other scripting or compiled languages.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Develop simple scripts in Julia using the REPL, code editors, and web-based IDEs
* Get to grips Juliaâ€™s type system, multiple dispatch, metaprogramming, and macro development
* Interact with data files, tables, data frames, SQL, and NoSQL databases
* Delve into statistical analytics, linear programming, and optimization problems
* Create graphics and visualizations to enhance modeling and simulation in Julia
* Understand Julia's main approaches to machine learning, Bayesian analysis, and AI

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is not an introduction to computer programming, but a practical guide for developers who want to enhance their basic knowledge of Julia, or those wishing to augment their skill set by adding Julia to their existing roster of programming languages. Familiarity with a scripting language such as Python or R, or a compiled language such as C/C++, C# or Java, is a prerequisite.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).
### Software and Hardware List
| Chapter | Software required | OS required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
